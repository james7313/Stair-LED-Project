    # Sensor Light
    
    **The Automation Process:**
     - In this example we will use a Motion sensor as the trigger but you can use one or multiple [Binary Sensors](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/binary_sensor/) as the trigger/s.
     - Triggers on a motion sensor and turns the lights ON. 
     - When no motion is detected, a time delay is activated and turns the lights OFF Automatically.
     - The lights will stay ON if the motion sensor detects motion before the time delay turns the lights OFF. It will then reset the time delay after last motion is detected.
     - You have the option to select scenes. This allows you to turn ON a scene when motion is detected and turn OFF a scene when the time delay has ended.
     - You have the option to use the "Light Control". This allows you to set a brightness level for your lights.
     - You have the option to use the "Trigger Sensor By-pass". This allows you to add a switch to manually By-pass the trigger sensor so you can use the lights as normal by turning them ON and OFF manually.
     - You have the option to use the "Sun Elevation". This is used for adding a condition to only work when it is dark by setting the suns position to the horizon.
     - You have the option to use the "Zone - Device Tracker". This can be useful if you have pets triggering the trigger sensor turning your lights ON and OFF when no one is home.
     
     Note: If you turn the light on manually and the motion sensor detects motion the light will turn off automatically. It is recommended to use the "Trigger Sensor By-pass" option if you would like to keep the lights ON or OFF for extended time periods.
